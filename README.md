## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q. I scroll to the bottom and nothing loads, what should I do?**\
Stay at the bottom: the ‚Äúnear-bottom‚Äù mechanism automatically triggers loading. If the network is slow, wait until the current batch finishes (check the status). If it still seems stuck, scroll slightly up and back down to re-trigger.

**Q. Favorites don‚Äôt appear immediately in ‚ÄúFavorites only‚Äù mode.**\
The list is refreshed automatically, but if there is still a delay, use **Refresh** to sync.

**Q. Why do some videos take time to show a preview?**\
Videos load metadata first. The preview appears after a micro-seek. On slow networks, a fallback forces full loading.
